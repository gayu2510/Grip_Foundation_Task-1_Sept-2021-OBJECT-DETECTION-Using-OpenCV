Object Detection / Optical Character Recognition (ORC) (Level - Beginner)

Implementation of an objectdetector which identifies realtime objects in an image or a video

Go to main.py for the code.
Import the 3 files from Object detection files which consists of the class names(coco names) and the pre-trained model and its weights.

When you run the code in your python ide your web cam would be accessed and the model would be labelling the objects that would be captured by your camera.
